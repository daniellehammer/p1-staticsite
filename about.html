        <h3>Where is Smith Island?</h3>
        <p>Smith Island is located in the Chesapeake Bay. Located in Somerset county, Smith Island is only accessible via boat. Visitors and residents alike board a ferry at the Crisfield City Dock. Crisfield is the last point of contact on the mainland of Maryland.
            Most residents ride over to Crisfield to purchase groceries or to visit a doctor. The distance between Tylerton, MD (located on Smith Island) and Crisfield is approximately 12 miles. This makes for a boat ride that is 45 minutes one way.
            Smith Island is made up of 3 "areas" of inhabitation. Tylerton, Ewell, and Rhodes Point. Although inhabited, the residents of the island are isolated due to the price and time of travel to the mainland. The people who live there have a distinct accent, which is
            a direct result of being isolated for most of their lives. Smith Island does receive mail via boat once a day.</p>

        <h3>What is Smith Island known for?</h3>
        <p>Smith Island's small population is known for its almost exclusive workforce of watermen. The vast majority of men on this island are watermen, and since the Chesapeake Bay
            is becoming a lot more polluted, it is heavily affecting the watermen's ability to catch enough crab. The island is also known for it's delicious seafood cuisine, most notably crab cakes.
            All restaurants on the island serve their homemade version of crab cake. More recently, Smith Island has become famous for it's <a href="https://smithislandcake.com/">Smith Island Cake</a>, 
            which is a layer cake that most women on the island learn to make while growing up. Smith Island Cake is also the Maryland State dessert.</p>
