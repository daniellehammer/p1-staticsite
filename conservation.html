              <h3>What does conservation have to do with Smith Island?</h3>
              <p>Great question. Smith Island is completely surrounded by the Chesapeake Bay. Believe it or not, the Chesapeake Bay is 
                  very polluted. This pollution, at face value, means that the water quailty is bad. This also means that water quality for island residents is terrible, watermen 
                  have smaller yields, and species become endangered, mutated or even extinct.

              <h3>How polluted is the Chesapeake Bay?</h3>
              <p>Short answer: very. The Chesapeake Bay foundation creates a rundown of pollution statistics every 2 years called the <a href="https://www.cbf.org/about-the-bay/state-of-the-bay-report/">State of the Bay Report</a>. The latest report 
            was compiled in 2020, and the overall score was a D+. Let's review the components of the report that make up this score. Click a topic to learn more.</p>
